# Cancel things out

## Description

Why do the *"Cancel"* button even exist in Android UI? It can be cancelled by clicking outside the dialog. I can't imagine anyone to be clicking this button to quit instead of clicking anywhere outside the dialog. Moreover, for 5 times.

## Instructions

Click on "Set Title" and then click "Cancel" from the dialog. Repeat that for 5 times.
