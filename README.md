# kun-calculator
Based on Lua for Android. Despite its name, the program is actually an egg-hunting game instead of a useless calculator.
It's basically an egg-hunting game. The version string says it all:

**a.b[c]**

The **"a"** represents the major version value.
The **"b"** represents the total points of achievements.
The **"c"** represents the build number.

It's a game all about clikcing and trying to find all hidden achievements. Currently only **Chinese** is available, more to be coming.

The *plus* version will be coded soon, which features a more complicated design and a community-based customized achievement system.
